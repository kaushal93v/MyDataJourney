### Project 1: PlanYourJourney
<h4><a href="https://github.com/kaushal93v/PlanYourJourney"> Web application for Cyclists of Melbourne</a></h4>
<p> PlanYourJourney is a web application that helps cyclists in Melbourne to reach their destination quicker and safer. Users can optimize their daily routes based on safety, traffic, and weather conditions. This application is built following Agile Methodology.</p>

### Project 2: Data Analysis Challenge
<h4><a href="https://github.com/kaushal93v/Data-Analysis-Challenge"> Classification of news articles using supervised machine learning algorithms</a></h4>
<p> Text documents are one of the richest information sources where we can learn valuable information for various purposes. As one of the important and typical analytic tasks in NLP/ML, document classification refers to labelling a document with one or more classes or categories. This has many applications like spam filtering, email routing, sentiment analysis. The objective of this challenge is to classify huge corpus of news articles using supervised machine learning models. </p>

### Project 3: USA Mass Shootings
<h4><a href="https://github.com/kaushal93v/USA-Mass-Shootings"> Interactive dashboard for analyzing USA Mass Shootings using d3.js and Tableau</a></h4>
<p> The country which has the highest number of mass shootings in history is the United States. Between the year 1966-2018, the United States has witnessed more than 328 mass shootings that resulted in more than 1477 deaths and 2025 injured. The main objective is to find out why the United States has the highest number of mass shootings in the history of all countries and how to put a check to the criminal offenses.
Is it because of the higher accessibility and ownership of guns or mental illness of the individuals who commit these activities or failure of the government background checks of citizens and unregulated laws related to guns?
This is achieved by exploring and visualizing US Mass shootings data from 1966 to 2018 using Tableau, R, and D3.js.</p>

### Project 4: Apache Spark Streaming Application
<h4><a href="https://github.com/kaushal93v/Spark-Streaming-Application"> Migrating data into MongoDB database and building streaming application in Spark</a></h4>
<p> StopFire is a campaign started by Monash University to predict and stop fires in Victorian cities. They have employed sensors in different cities of Victoria to detect fires and have collected a huge amount of data, which they couldn't handle using their traditional database. The objective of this project is to migrate their data into a NoSQL database using MongoDB and build a streaming application using Apache Kafka and Apache Spark.</p>
